# Access-Webpage-using-HTTPD-in-Linux
In this project I have used HTTPD web server to host web pages in Linux, how we can set up a web server in our Linux environment, deploy our first simple HTML-based web page, and how we can access our web page from the browser.

 **What is HTTPD ?**

HTTP Daemon is a software program that runs in the background of a web server and waits for incoming server requests.

The daemon answers the request automatically and serves the hypertext and multimedia documents over the Internet using HTTP.
